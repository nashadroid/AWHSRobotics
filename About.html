				BEST stands for "Boosting Engineering, Science, and Technology" and is a national robotics competition.
				Every fall, BEST releases a fun and exciting gameboard that correlates to real-life applications for robots.
				Teams across the nation then build robots to compete in their local and regional competitions.
